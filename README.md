# ISAD(G) to RiC

This repository was created within the MAS-thesis in Information Science of Josip Spec at the [University of Applied Sciences of the Grisons](https://www.fhgr.ch/en/).

The repository holds the transformations of holdings from 3 GLAM-institutions ([Bibliothek Zug](www.bibliothekzug.ch), [Stadtarchiv Zug](https://www.stadtzug.ch/stadtarchiv) and [Museum Burg Zug](https://www.burgzug.ch/)) to the [Records in Context Ontology v.02 (RiC-O)](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/) des [International Council on Archives (ICA)](https://www.ica.org/).

The original catalogues were exported from relational databases and transformed to [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/).
